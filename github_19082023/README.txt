Analysis code used in "The laminar pattern of proprioceptive activation in human primary motor cortex" (uploaded on git 19082023).

Preprocessing code is in files named by "preprocessing" or "pipeline". getProfile scripts contain code to generate figures and statistics. 

Note, code to run blurring simulation (3d-bssfp) is in "blurringSimulation_2kernels.m", and code to run BOLD draining correction with spatial deconvolution is embedded in getProfilesVASO.m
